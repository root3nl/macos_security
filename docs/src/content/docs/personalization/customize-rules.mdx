title: Customizing Rules
description: A customization reference.

import { Steps, FileTree, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The project supports **modifying existing rules** and **adding new rules** to a baseline to meet your organization's requirements. Customizing a rule means changing the rule's content itself, while [tailoring](./Tailoring-rules) is about selecting which rules to include in a benchmark.

<Aside type="note">
For existing rules, only keep the fields you want to customize. This ensures your custom rules remain compatible as the project updates for future OS releases.
</Aside>

## Modifying an Existing Rule

<Steps>
1. **Copy** the existing rule file to the `custom` folder. The filename must remain the same.
2. **Remove** any fields that don’t need to be modified.
3. **Edit** the fields to match your organization’s requirements.
4. **Run** `generate_guidance.py`. The custom version of the rule will be included in the output.
</Steps>

**Example: Configure macOS to Use an Authorized Time Server**

```yaml
references:
  custom:
    MSCP:
      - MSCP-OS-001
    URL:
      - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/timeserver
    Remediation Tool:
      - MDM
```

## Adding a New Rule

<Steps>
1. **Create** a new `rules.yaml` file in the `custom` folder.
   - If your rule uses a configuration profile payload not already in the project, add it to `supported_payloads.yaml` in the `includes` folder.
2. **Run** `generate_baseline.py` to add the new rule to your baseline.
3. **Run** `generate_guidance.py` against your customized baseline.
</Steps>

## Use Case: Informational Rules (No Check/Result/Fix)

If you want a custom rule that explains a control but does **not** include a check, result, or fix, add the `manual` tag. This ensures it does **not** appear in the compliance script.

**Example Rule (No Check/Result/Fix)**

```yaml
check: |
result: |
fix: | 
tag:
  - manual
```
