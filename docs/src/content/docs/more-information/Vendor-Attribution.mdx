## Mosyle – Mosyle Business

> "macOS hardening & compliance is a foundational requirement for all organizations using Apple as they work to minimize risk. It would take countless labor hours if each company had to dissect the operating system and applications within their environment to achieve this goal. The excellent work by NIST macOS Security compliance project and other trusted standards provide frameworks and methodologies to alleviate the burden of individually identifying each setting and feature’s “safe” configuration. As macOS increases in capabilities with each version, so does the library of controls these frameworks address. These public projects continue to grow in scale and value through the collaborative effort put forth by their authors. We rely on these resources to provide our customers with easy to implement, standards-based security controls for each entity’s hardening and compliance needs."

## Tenable

> "Tenable, Inc. automated the conversion of https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security YAML rules into the .audit format using Python and YAML libraries. Programmatically approaching this conversion allows for faster future releases, consistency, and maintaining the integrity of the source content. Because the YAML content is all command driven, this is converted to Tenable’s CMD_EXEC check type for use with the Unix plugin. The YAML rules have a “tags” section that was used to create unique audit profiles related to common frameworks."
