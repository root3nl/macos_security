title: Rules File Layout
description: A rules reference.
---

A rule file defines a single security control for macOS. Each rule is written in YAML and should follow the structure below.

## Rule File Fields

### id
A unique identifier for the rule. This should match the filename (without the `.yaml` extension).

### title
A human-readable title for the rule.

### discussion
A concise description of the rule's intent and context.

### check
A shell-based or script-based check to validate compliance.

### result
The expected result from the check.

### fix
Remediation steps or configuration to enforce the rule. If a fix includes `[source,bash]`, it will be used for script generation.

### references
Mappings to CCEs, security frameworks, and controls relevant to the rule.

### macOS
The macOS versions for which this rule is validated.

### odv
(Optional) Organization Defined Values. If present, should include a hint and default/recommended values.

### tags
Keywords for categorizing and searching rules.

### severity
The severity level of the rule (e.g., low, medium, high).

### mobileconfig
Set to `true` if the rule can be enforced via a configuration profile.

### mobileconfig_info
Required if `mobileconfig` is `true`. Contains the configuration profile payload.

## Example Rule File

```yaml
id: system_settings_bluetooth_disable
title: Disable Bluetooth When no Approved Device is Connected
discussion: |
  The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to disable Bluetooth unless there is an approved device connected.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable Bluetooth, so as to maintain necessary functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
  ====
check: |
  /usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript << EOS
  $.NSUserDefaults.alloc.initWithSuiteName('com.apple.MCXBluetooth')\
  .objectForKey('DisableBluetooth').js
  EOS
result:
  string: 'true'
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
