description: Reference for the includes directory.

The `includes/` directory contains reusable YAML libraries that support the repository's build scripts.  
These libraries provide structured data and helper content used to:

- Build validation scripts
- Generate mobileconfig files
- Assemble guide documents

**Purpose:**  
Centralize supporting YAML files so scripts can efficiently parse and reuse information across different outputs.

**Tip:**  
Keep this directory organized and up-to-date to ensure all scripts have access to the latest supporting data.
