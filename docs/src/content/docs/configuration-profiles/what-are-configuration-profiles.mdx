**Apple Configuration Profiles** are XML files (.mobileconfig) used to define settings, restrictions, and policies for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS devices. They allow administrators to manage and enforce configurations such as Wi-Fi settings, VPN, certificates, security restrictions, and more across Apple devices.

### How Configuration Profiles Work

Configuration profiles are created by IT administrators and can be distributed to devices via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Apple Configurator, email, or direct download. Once installed, the profile automatically applies the specified settings to the device. Profiles can be signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.

### End-User Experience

For end-users, configuration profiles are typically deployed silently and automatically through the organization's MDM solution. Once the profile is pushed to the device, most restrictions and settings are enforced immediatelyâ€”users may notice changes right away, or in some cases, a reboot may be required before all settings take full effect.

Profiles can be viewed or removed in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Profiles** (macOS) or **Settings > General > VPN & Device Management** (iOS/iPadOS).

<Aside type="note">
If a configuration profile is deployed via a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, the user cannot remove it manually. Only the MDM administrator can remove or update these profiles, ensuring organizational control and compliance.
