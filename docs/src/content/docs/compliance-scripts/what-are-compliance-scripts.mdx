Compliance scripts in the NIST macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP) are automated scripts designed to check and enforce security settings on macOS systems. These scripts are generated from the project's baselines, which define recommended security controls and configurations.

The compliance scripts allow organizations to:

- **Assess**: Automatically check a system's current configuration against the selected baseline.
- **Remediate**: Apply changes to bring the system into compliance with the baseline.
- **Report**: Generate output showing which settings are compliant or non-compliant.

These scripts are typically generated using the project's tooling and can be run locally or integrated into enterprise management workflows. They help ensure that macOS devices meet NIST and organizational security requirements efficiently and consistently.
