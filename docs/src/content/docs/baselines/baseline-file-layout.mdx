Baseline files define the controls and rules that make up a security profile. They are used to generate guides, scripts, and mobileconfig files for macOS security.

## Baseline File Structure

A baseline file typically includes the following fields:

### title
A human-readable name for the baseline.  
*Example:*  
```yaml
title: "Apple macOS 13 (Ventura) Test Baseline"
```

### description
A brief summary describing the purpose and scope of the baseline.  
*Example:*  
```yaml
description: |
  This guide describes the prudent actions to take when securing a macOS 13 system against the Test Baseline.
```

### authors
A list of authors and their organizations.  
*Example:*  
```yaml
authors: |
  |===
  |John Smith|NIST
  |Jack Doe|NIST
  |===
```

### profile
Defines the structure of the baseline, mapping sections to their associated rules:  
- **section**: The name of the section (as defined in the `sections` directory) to be included in the guide.
- **rules**: A list of rule IDs that are part of this section. Each rule ID should match the filename and ID of a corresponding rule in the `rules` directory.

*Example:*
```yaml
profile:
  - section: "Authentication"
    rules:
      - auth_pam_login_smartcard_enforce
      - auth_pam_su_smartcard_enforce
      - auth_pam_sudo_smartcard_enforce
      - auth_smartcard_allow
  - section: "Auditing"
    rules:
      - audit_acls_files_configure
      - audit_acls_files_mode_configure
      - audit_acls_folder_wheel_configure
```
