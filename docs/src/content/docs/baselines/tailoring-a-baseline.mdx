import { Steps, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tailoring allows you to create a custom security baseline that fits your organization's needs. The tailoring process lets you select which rules to include and set organization-defined values (ODVs) for controls that require them.

<FileTree>
- macos_security/
    - scripts/
        - generate_baseline.py    ---> Script to generate and tailor baselines
</FileTree>

Follow these steps to tailor a baseline:

<Steps>

1. **Start the Tailoring Script**

   - Run the script with the `-t` flag to begin tailoring:
     ```sh
     ./macos_security/scripts/generate_baseline.py -k 800-53r5_moderate -t
     ```
     Replace `800-53r5_moderate` with your desired baseline tag.

2. **Enter Basic Information**

   - You will be prompted for:
     - Benchmark Name
     - Authorâ€™s Name
     - Organization

3. **Select Rules to Include**

   - For each rule, you will be asked whether to include it in your tailored baseline:
     ```
     Would you like to include the rule for "audit_acls_files_configure" in your benchmark? [Y/n/all/?]:
     ```
   - Enter `?` to see more details about a rule.

4. **Set Organization Defined Values (ODVs)**

   - If a rule requires an ODV, you will be prompted to enter a value or accept the recommended default:
     ```
     Number of failed attempts.
     Enter the ODV for "pwpolicy_account_lockout_enforce" or press Enter for the recommended value (3):
     ```

5. **Review Output Files**

   - After completing the prompts, the following files are created:

</Steps>

<FileTree>
- macos_security/
    - build/
        - baselines/
            - YOUR_BENCHMARK.yaml   ---> The tailored baseline file
    - custom/
        - rules/
            - *.yaml                ---> Custom ODV values for tailored rules
</FileTree>

Each tailored rule with a custom ODV will have a YAML file like:

```yaml
odv:
  custom: 11
```

- The `odv.custom` value reflects your organization's choice for that rule.

*Use these tailored files to generate guidance or further customize your security posture. For more details, see [Customization](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/wiki/Customization).*
