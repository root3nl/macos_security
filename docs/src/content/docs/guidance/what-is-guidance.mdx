**Guidance** provides clear documentation for security controls, describing what each control is, its purpose, and how it protects your systems.

- **Explanations of security controls:** Clarifies the intent and importance of each control, and how it contributes to securing macOS systems.
- **Implementation steps:** Offers detailed instructions for configuring macOS settings to meet baseline requirements.
- **Assessment procedures:** Outlines methods to verify that systems are properly configured and compliant with security objectives.
- **References and rationale:** Includes links to relevant NIST standards, Apple documentation, and other authoritative sources to support each control.

You can generate guidance files based on the created baseline in formats such as AsciiDoc, HTML, and PDF. These documents are often required by organizations for submission, enabling administrators to efficiently document and justify how the baseline is enforced and the reasoning behind each control.
